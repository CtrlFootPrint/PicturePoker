# PicturePoker
A Clone of the Picture Poker game in NSMB/SM64DS. Gameplay will be similar to what is seen on the bottom screen of the game.

The objective of the game is to receive the best hand. 5 random cards will be dealt to the player and the computer, each card can range from 6 types of cards - Cloud, Mushroom, Flower, Luigi, Mario and Star. The hands can be separated into different ranks - Junk, 1 pair, 2 pairs, 3 of a kind, Full House, 4 of a kind and 5 of a kind.
The cards will be compared in terms of hand ranks. If they are equal, the suits will be compared, for example, 3 of a kind made up of three stars will beat a 3 of a kind made up of three clouds. If the suits are also equal, a draw is declared.

The player starts with 10 coins, and at level 0. Each hand rank has its own value, which is multiplied by the amount of coins that are used to bet (with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 5). For example, if the player wins with a 4 of a kind, and has betted 2 coins, they will receive 16 coins, since the 4 of a kind rank has a multiplier of 8. If the player loses, they will lose the coins they have placed for their bet. A draw will result in the coins being returned to the player.

The level will increase every time the player wins, decrease when the player loses and does not change in the case of a draw. The minimum amount of coins that the player bets increases several times, as the player reaches a certain level.

The .rar file includes an executable file of the game to run on Windows computers.
